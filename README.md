# AHTPeptideFusion

## AHTPeptideFusionï¼šA segmented fusion ACE-I inhibitory peptide predictor based on a protein language model and machine learning.

We provide a virtual environment to run AHTPeptideFusion,

You can use 
```shell
conda env create -f AHTPeptideFusion.yaml
```
to follow the required dependency packages.

Moreover, We provide prediction code and model for AHTPeptideFusion and an example of using AHTPeptideFusion to predict ACE-I inhibitory peptides in the Jupyter Notebook.
